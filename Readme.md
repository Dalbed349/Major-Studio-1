This file searches the database and performs a few counting functions.
The data is saved into a json.

### testgraph.js 
This file attempts to replicate the flower textile graph found in the lab. 
I am currently unable to get the counter to add up for each material type. 
The result is a list of the 683 material types found in my object but not clustered together.
